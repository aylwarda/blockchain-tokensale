# blockchain-tokensale
This project is all about the creation of a token and working through a crowdsale of the token.  Within the period of the sale, limits of both time and total amount minted, are made.  OpenZeppelin's ERC standard contracts are used throughout (one has to be safe, you know!)

- Remix has been used as the IDE for this little project
- Ganache has also been used to help with the testing off-chain
- I made use of the Chainlink Faucet for the ETH I used in this project, find that [here](https://faucets.chain.link/kovan)
- For the on-chain testing, I used the Kovan Testnet (more [here](https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/))
- Learn all about OpenZeppelin and the standards of safety they provide at https://docs.openzeppelin.com but more specifically relating to Crowdsales [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/crowdsales)
- Ethereum Foundation needs to be acknowledged for their work, creating their blockchain, which allows for the deplyment and interaction with "smart-contracts"
